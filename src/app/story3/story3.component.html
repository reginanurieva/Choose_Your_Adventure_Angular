  <p class="panel panel-default">As an ancient wizard, great and powerful, you are often asked why you allow wars to continue. As someone of great strength, isn't it your obligation to offer protection to the helpless, to prevent famine and pestilence, to feed the starving and warm the cold?
    <br>But no one ever asks how your knees feel, or wonder how long it takes to walk down that mountain path from your magical fortress. Your poor, enchanted pack mule, Eldemere, is almost five hundred years old, for goodness's sake.
    <br>But no matter. You've heard word of the terrible goings-on in the lands below your magical fortress. Perhaps it's been too long since you visited civilization.
    <br>You make your way out of Mount Awful's foothills into the flatlands, where you can already hear the clashing of small swords in petty squabbles. The sun is high above, near it's zenith. You begin walking, and by the time you reach the town of Bilderberry, you realize you haven't eaten since breakfast. Making your way into the town, you stop by the Inn, seeking a small snack. Vegetable stew, perhaps.
    <br>"Greetings, young man. I have an old ass in need of feeding. And my mule outside is hungry, too," you say with a chuckle. The Innkeeper stares at you blankly. "Quite famished," you offer with a smile.
    <br>"I beg your patience, good sir. We are in the beginnings of a siege, and our facilities are stretched beyond their normal capacities."
    <br>A siege? You think back to the thoudsands of armored dwarves surrounding the city, as you approached Bilderberry. Perhaps this is the sort of thing people always complain about, you think, as you sigh.
    <br>Walking back outside, you leave Eldemere with the stable boy, and make your way back out the city gate to the forces preparing to attack.
    <br>"Excuse me," you say, tapping a dwarf on his armored pauldron. "I'd like to speak to your leader, please." You're met with a sneer you very much do not appreciate, and insist again that you speak to whoever calls themself captain of this regiment.
    <br>"I am these good dwarves leader. I am called Sneed, and we are here to-"
    <br>"Very good. Do you intend to put this town under siege, and then attack them?"
    <br>"We do," Sneed answers with narrowing eyes. "Perhaps you should make haste away from the castle, good si-"
    <br>Silece falls over the camp as Sneed disappears from view. Looking down, you look at a frog witting amongst Sneed's previously-occupied plate armor. A dozen men pick up swords, and step toward you. They too disappear, as a quiet chorus of ribbits fill the camp. A dozen frogs begin hopping around, free of their armor.
    <br>"Is that all?" you ask pleasantly, looking around at the pale-faced dwarves, glancing from you to the frogs hopping to and fro, then to you again. "I'll take that as a yes."
    <br>There is no movement from the camp until you say, "Perhaps it's time everyone heads home?" and are met with an enthusiastic rush from thousands of dwarves all taking what they can carry, and running away on foot.
    <br>You walk back into Bilderberry, petting Eldemere the Mule as you pass her by, walking into the Inn. "Young man, I would like some vegetable stew. Quite famished, you see."<br>
  <p>THE END.</p>
