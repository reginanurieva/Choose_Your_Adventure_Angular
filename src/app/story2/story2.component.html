  <p class="panel panel-default">An ear-piercing clang of metal on metal wakes you from your stupor. An empty whiskey bottle falls off the table with a <strong>thud</strong> as you startle awake. You can hear the roar and screams of a battle outside, and know it is time to take action. Things have not been so good lately, the past ten years or so, but that's no excuse. It's time to be a <strong>hero</strong>.
    <br>Staggering to your feet, you pulls both suspenders up, securing your trousers. One of the buttons securing the strap on the right shoulder pops off, sending the that suspender dangling down by your leg. But there is no time for that now! There's no time for anything except saving the town you love.
    <br>...Okay, perhaps not <strong>loves</strong>. Perhaps love is a strong word, but...
    <br>No! There's no time for this. You charge out the front door where you find...nothing. The battle has already moved on and left him behind. Maybe it's for the best, you think. You aren't really cut out for being a hero, or you probably would have already been one. Besides, you're a little past your prime, don't have any weapons, no training, you're by yourself...
    <br>But the heroism you felt a moment ago surges back as a fire rises up in the distance. Off you stumble, toward the action!
    <br>To be fair, someone in town should have to put up a sign saying the stones on the bridge are wet. The suspender you lost earlier now wraps around your leg, tripping you, and over the side you go, slowly drifting down river with the current. You watch as city drifts by, with no obvious way to get out. Eventually, you drift out of the city entirely, and by then you're growing used to the river. The temperature isn't bad, after all. As the city drifts away, you think about how this might be for the best anyway.<br>Maybe you can find somewhere to finish your nap.<br>
  <p>THE END.</p>
